# Phonons_Programs
Description of the Programs Used to the Analysis of the Phonons in Silicon Detector.

Resonators_Qubits.C
This Programs takes two trees from the root File generated on the Simulation.
The Program is designed to plot the initial and final parameters as: Energy, Position.
The programs contains the sensitive areas.
The Programs calcualte the Probability Density Plot in 2D by Filling the Number of Bins (800 x 800).
This is the more completed program used for the Phonon Analyis. The goal is to create a Class.
